### Q.1 What is Aadhar seeding?
Aadhaar seeding is necessitated for receiving Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT) provided by various Government. Aadhar seeding is a process of linking any customer's 12 digit aadhar number with their bank account.The following is the process flow of Aadhaar seeding:

**1. Customer to visit the bank branch where he / she is holding an account and submit the duly filled
consent form – Annexure I**

**2. The bank officials after verifying the details and documents provided (as may be required) and
authenticity of the customer based on the signature will accept Aadhaar seeding consent form and
provide an acknowledgement to the customer.**

**3. The branch will then link the Aadhaar number to the customer’s account and also in NPCI mapper.**

**4. Once this activity is completed and Aadhaar number will reflect in NPCI mapper.**


#### Role of the customer:

1. Submit the consent form with complete details either in physical or electronic form as per the facility
provided by his / her bank.

2. In case of moving Aadhaar number from one bank to another bank, the customer should provide the
name of the bank from which the Aadhaar is being moved.

3. In case of physical form, the consent form should be duly signed as per the bank records.


#### Role of the Bank / Branch:

1. Verifying the completeness of the consent form, checking the documentation and authenticating the
customer’s signature.

2. After the officials are satisfied with the documentation they should carry out the following activities
a. Linking the Aadhaar number to the bank account (in CBS)
b. Updating NPCI mapper

Note: By linking the Aadhaar number to the account the branch is not updating the mapper. The
mapper update process has to be followed by their central team or IT division as the case may be.

3. After the mapper files are uploaded the response files received from NPCI have to be verified.
   
4. In case of failure in updating any Aadhaar number/s then necessary corrective action has to be
taken and CBS also should be updated accordingly.

5. Customer query / complaint handling.
   
5.1- Branches should understand that if Aadhaar number is not updated in NPCI mapper the action
is purely lies with the bank only. The customer should not be told that NPCI has not updated the
Aadhaar number.

5.2- Aadhaar number being active in bank’s CBS does not mean that mapper file is updated, the
branch should not show CBS screen or provide screen shot to the customer confirming seeding.

5.3- If the customer complaints, the branch should approach their internal team handling Aadhaar
mapping and ascertain the reason for non-updating the Aadhaar in NPCI mapper.

5.4- After ascertaining the root cause bank should take corrective action and redress the grievance
of the customer.

### Q.3 Does the bank send the e-Mandate on the same day?

### Q.4 What is NACH?
National Automated Clearing House (NACH) is a platform created by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to facilitate fund clearing. NACH Credit and NACH Debit provide interbank high volume, high or low-value credit/debit bulk transactions that are recurring/repetitive through the electronic NPCI service. For example, if I make a purchase and every month an EMI amount gets auto-debited from your bank account. 

**Process:**

- Companies provide NACH mandate forms to customers to get their consent for debiting their account at a certain frequency for a certain period of time.

- The Company will verify all details provided by customers in their NACH mandate form.

- Upon successful verification, the company/corporate will forward the form to its sponsor bank.


- The bank will send the mandate form to NPCI.


- Once the details are fully validated, NPCI will forward the mandate form to the customer’s bank.


- Upon approval of the customer’s bank, the company is permitted to debit funds from the customer’s account. 


- If the customer’s bank mandate registration fails due to any false information, the customer’s bank redirects the information to NPCI, which then  redirects this information to sponsored bank. The sponsored bank subsequently redirects this information to the corporate.
