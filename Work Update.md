# NACH

## (National Automated Clearing House)

### Overview

- NACH brings together all ECS systems across the country, cutting through local obstacles to pave the way for a faster and more efficient clearing system. This move is geared towards keeping up with the high number of daily monetary transactions.

- NACH reduces the need for paperwork, manual verification also cutting down the processing timelines.

- NACH significantly cuts down on processing timelines. ECS mandate registrations took up to 30 days. Under NACH, this is cut by half to 15 days. ECS payment settlement usually took 3–4 days, while NACH settles payments on the same day.

**Before moving forward we should understand about mandate and e-mandate:**

## **Mandate**

</center> 

### Types of Mandates:

**1. Physical Mandate:**


**2. eMandate:**

**3.Aadhar based mandate**

- A bank mandate is an authorization given to a bank or financial institution (a broker, fund house, lender, etc.) to debit our bank account for recurring (or one time) payments. 


### Physical Mandate:
- The payer’s physical signature is required to authenticate the mandate and is sent by the financial institution to customer's bank for registration on customer's behalf. Once the mandate is registered with customer's bank, the bank will allow the institution to withdraw the amount at the frequency pre-defined, or as and when the mandate is presented.

**Physical mandate form sample:**

### Physical Mandate Registration Process

### The Challenge
Although NACH is a significant upgrade to the old ECS system,the process of physically registering NACH mandates still encounters some inefficiencies.

**- Manual Data Entry & Verification**

The mandate form is filled in manually by either the payer (customer) or by an agent assigned by the corporate in consultation with the payer. As with most manual processes, this is prone to human error. Incorrect data entry can be costly, resulting in delays and mandate registration failures.


**- Matching NPCI-defined Image Specifications**

The Sponsor Bank must ensure that the mandate image and data that they pass on to the NPCI meet NPCI’s pre-defined specifications. This, again, is prone to human error and can result in the rejection of the mandate.

**- Drawn-out Turnaround Time (TAT)**

Between the generation of the UMRN to when the mandate is registered, the NPCI-defined TAT is T+10 days (From Sponsor bank to NPCI to Customer Bank). Looking at the overall process, and considering the Lead Time (From Customer to corporate to Sponsor bank), It's take a timeline of close to 15–20 days. **Since the corporate cannot take any action until the mandate is registered, there is a significant delay in the business flow.**

### eMandate
</center>

eMandate is a digital payment service initiated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). It acts as the underlying infrastructure enabling Indian businesses to collect recurring payments without the need for human interaction.

### eMandate Registration Process

![Alt text](<emandate .png>)

- The eMandate registration process is noticeably less convoluted than the physical mandate process.

 - The elimination of the need for a physical mandate form brings down the defined TAT from T+10 days (in the physical mandate registration case) to T+2 days. 


### Aadhar eSign Mandate:

- The eSign electronic signature service is a cutting-edge project that allows for the simple, efficient, and safe signing of electronic documents by authenticating signers utilizing Aadhaar eKYC services


 - In the eSign mandate, the user just has to put the OTP that they receive on their phone number which is linked to their Aadhaar card. 
 This process takes 3-5 days .
